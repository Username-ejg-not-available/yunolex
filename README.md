# yunolex

A massive improvement to [this](https://github.com/ephing/dragontrials/tree/main/trial1).

I made my lexer have better UX and also I bootstrapped the regex parser.

The grammar in [parser/docs/regex.grammar](https://github.com/ephing/yunolex/blob/main/parser/docs/regex.grammar) is adapted from [this](https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/~cameron/Teaching/384/99-3/regexp-plg.html)
